### What is this?

This project is an attempt to implement Vue's API at compile time, rather than run time. Frameworks like Svelte demonstrate that this is possible to do, and is likely the future of web frameworks. Hopefully, when all is said and done this will be a framework with the amazing compile time logic of Svelte, mixed with the beautiful and expressive API of Vue.

> **Warning:** This project is a work in progress, and is not ready for use by anyone.
